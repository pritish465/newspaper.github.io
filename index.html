            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">Sewage Scandal!</span><p><span class="headline hl6">Mass amounts of poop being put into food.</span></p></div>
            The police have had an investigation into Fred Fartson, after he had been accused of dumping the cities sewage into the Cluckin' Bell oil. He was found guilty this morning, and was fired from his job as sewage manager.
     </p>
    <p>
      Over the past week or so, Los Santos has gotten an influx of sewage, presumably from new baked beans stores opening. Fred Fartson couldn't find out a way to get rid of the sewage responsibly, so he decided to dump it into the oil in the Cluckin' Bell Factory. Many people are sick from this, so make sure to be careful and wash your hands. He was sentenced to 2 years in prison after this whole operation, and police are still further investigating the Poop Sector of the Los Santos council to see if anyone is involved. If you think you know someone who may have been involved, either in the Cluckin' Bell factory, or in the Poop Sector, please call 1300-Poop-Scandal immediately, or report directly to the LSPD.

            <p>Jeffrey Jefferson has recently reported to the police about a baked beans scam. The store "Beans R Us" has been scamming it's customers, and not giving them the right amount of beans.<span class="citation">"The beans are a scam!"</span> says Jeffrey. Beans R Us is a shop where you can buy baked beans in bulk, but Jeffrey has noticed something off. He had ordered 3 bags of 2173 baked beans, yet after counting the beans, he noticed that each bag had substantially less beans than what he ordered.</p>
            <p>The police began an investigation into the store yesterday. They found many people have had the same experience as Jeffrey. At 2c a bean, it seems like a good deal, but it's a scam. We are still awaiting results on whether the store owners are guilty or not, but there is one thing I can say: Be careful with your beans.</p></div>

  <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">Tiny Terror</span><p><span class="headline hl4">Tree Frogs escape from the zoo.</span></p></div><p>On Monday this week, tree frogs began to overrun the city. They managed to escape from the reptile. area in the zoo. The city has been taken over by tree frogs. Many residents have been scared by the tree frogs, but there is no reason to fear them. They are harmless to humans.</p>
					
					<p>Many sections of the city are being reconcreted due to mass frog poop smudged on the concrete. These frog poop attacks are happening everywhere, mass groups of tree frogs congregate in one location, and defecate all over the concrete, leaving the area completely browned, and the concrete sticky, and impossible to walk on. Over 35 people have had fatal incidents with the frog poop, either suffocating in it, or slipping over and, well, dying. Be careful for any brown concrete, because it is usually a giant pit of death.</p></div>
